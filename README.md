# bullotron
A raspberry pie that makes automatic soap bubbles.


# Project idea
## Initial situation
As part of the Embedded Systems and Hardware Hacking module at FFHS HS 21/22, the use of embedded systems is to be trained using a smaller project. We wanted to create a product that would not simply end up in a container after the evaluation, but would also be used after this module. And no one deserves a little attention more than our close ones, who due to job and studies otherwise often come shorter than we would like. 

## The final product
We want to develop a fully automatic bubble machine. This should be able to do the following:
- Lower the bubble ring into the soap and lift it in front of the fan.
- Switch the fan on and off and regulate the strength of the bubbles.
- Measure the soap level, but at least report too low level
- Set the fan strength and blowing time on a screen
- Display the soap level on a screen
- Start the sequence via a prominent and remote button (possibly via RF)
- Via mail / MQTT inform the parents about a low soap level.

in active developpment.
